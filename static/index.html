              Replace all labels and inputs with the relevant features for your
              model
              Attributes to note:
              id: this is used on the front end to link the label to the input
              name: this is used on the back end when you submit the form; it
                becomes the key in the params dictionary
              value: this is the default value of the input. not necessary but
                helpful for speeding up demos

              The <br>s between each label/input combo are a quick and easy way
              to put each one on its own line. They aren't necessary for the
              form to function but they help the flow without needing a lot of
              nested <div>s to achieve the desired layout

        <p>
          Our model takes into consideration the rating and number of ratings for each movie in order to best predict the most similar movies for each movie selected. The movies with the strongest correlation are recommended.
